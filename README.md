## Welcome! How do you feel?

You can start by looking at the awesome repository FTEC4999!

Something just for fun: https://raw.githack.com/chrislam2/SwordArtOnlineWebpage/main/index.html

Then, these are also awesone repositories:
MNIST-CNN: Project related to CNN Neural Network and U-Net
CSCI3320: Machine Learning Algorithms

My old account name is AssoStudent. The reason I changed the name is that some stupid people think this is a stupid name.
